## Why I Built It ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’¡

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how **music can be seen as well as heard**. Watching lights respond to beats brings sound to life in a completely different way.  

During my summer holidays, I wanted to learn **Python**â€”since itâ€™s such a widely used language in software development, automation, and creative projects. At the same time, I was a member of our college Music Club *Tarang* under the band *Fusion*.  

ðŸŽ¤ Singing has always been a dear hobby to me, but I couldnâ€™t contribute much to the band as I was heavily involved in the Robotics Club *Technocrats*.  

So, I thought of building a project that would **bridge this gap between my love for music and my interest in technology**. The **LED Music Visualizer** became that project. I absolutely enjoyed the processâ€”every run gave me a chance to see my voice come alive through lights and improve it further.  

âœ¨ And when it finally worked, I found myself singing for hours, mesmerized by how the lights danced with my voice.
